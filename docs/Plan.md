Design Document: Personal Website Using Gatsby
Objective:

Create a personal website that functions as a professional portfolio, blog, and landing page. The website should be simple to manage, highly customizable, and allow you to publish blog posts written in Markdown. You will host the website on GitHub Pages and automate deployment using GitHub Actions.
Design Overview
Pages and Layout

    Landing Page (/)
        Purpose: Provide a brief, welcoming introduction to who you are, and guide visitors to other sections of the website.
        Content:

            Links to the About, Portfolio, and Blog pages.
            Call-to-action button(s) (e.g., "View Portfolio" or "Read My Blog").
        Visual Design:
            Clean and minimalist design with a focus on typography.
            Use a background color or subtle gradient, with high-contrast call-to-action buttons.
            Include personal branding elements like a logo or custom font for your name.

    About Page (/about)
        Purpose: Give visitors an overview of your professional background, skills, and accomplishments.
        Content:
            Professional bio including your experience, skills, and key achievements.

        Visual Design:
            Simple and professional layout, with sections clearly divided (e.g., Experience, Skills, Achievements).
            Use subtle animations (e.g., fade-in text or icons) to keep the design engaging but not overwhelming.

    Portfolio Page (/portfolio)
        Purpose: Showcase key projects that highlight your technical skills and expertise.
        Content:
            List of 3-5 featured projects, each with:
                Project name and brief description.
                Technologies used.
                Outcome or impact (e.g., reduced load times, increased revenue, etc.).
                Links to GitHub repositories (if public) or live demo.
        Visual Design:
            Use cards or grid layout for projects.
            Include screenshots or images of each project.
            Hover effects on project cards to make the portfolio feel interactive.
            Maintain a clean, minimalist style in line with the landing page.

Features
Core Features

    Markdown-Based Blog System:
        Purpose: Write blogs in Markdown and have Gatsby automatically convert them into HTML pages during the build process.
        Implementation:
            Store Markdown files in the /content/blog directory.
            Use the gatsby-transformer-remark plugin to process Markdown files into static pages.
            Use frontmatter (metadata at the top of each Markdown file) to specify title, date, and description.

    Dynamic Routing for Blog Posts:
        Purpose: Automatically generate URLs for each blog post based on the title or slug.
        Implementation:
            Gatsby will generate individual pages for each blog post using dynamic routing based on the slug (e.g., /blog/my-first-post).
            Gatsby’s file system routing API will be used to create these routes.

    GitHub Pages Hosting:
        Purpose: Host the website on GitHub Pages.
        Implementation:
            The site will be configured to publish from the gh-pages branch.
            GitHub Actions will be set up to automate deployment on each push to the main branch.

    Customizable CSS:
        Purpose: Enable easy customization of the site’s appearance using CSS.
        Implementation:
            You’ll use your own custom CSS files or a CSS framework like TailwindCSS for flexibility.
            Each page (e.g., Blog, Portfolio) will have its own dedicated styles to ensure consistency across the site.
            Ensure responsiveness for mobile and desktop viewing.

    SEO Optimization:
        Purpose: Improve the site’s visibility in search engines.
        Implementation:
            Use the gatsby-plugin-react-helmet plugin to manage the <head> tags for each page (meta descriptions, page titles, social sharing images).
            Ensure fast load times and optimize images.

Non-Essential (Optional) Features

    Dark Mode Toggle:
        Purpose: Allow users to switch between light and dark mode.
        Implementation:
            Implement a toggle button that switches between light and dark themes, using CSS variables for theming.

    Tag or Category System for Blog:
        Purpose: Organize blog posts into tags or categories.
        Implementation:
            Extend the frontmatter of each blog post to include tags or categories.
            Implement a filtering system on the blog page to allow users to view posts by specific tags.

    Search Functionality:
        Purpose: Allow users to search through blog posts.
        Implementation:
            Use the gatsby-plugin-algolia for indexing blog posts and implementing search functionality on the blog page.
            Alternatively, implement a simple client-side search using JavaScript.

    Newsletter Subscription:
        Purpose: Allow visitors to subscribe to your blog or updates.
        Implementation:
            Add a subscription form on the blog or landing page, integrated with a service like Mailchimp or ConvertKit.
