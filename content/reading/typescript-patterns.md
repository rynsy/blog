Currently working through this comprehensive guide on advanced TypeScript patterns. The conditional types section is particularly mind-bending but powerful.

The examples around mapped types and template literal types are opening up new possibilities for type-safe APIs. Still processing some of the more complex utility type implementations, but the fundamentals are solid.

Plan to experiment with these patterns in upcoming projects to see how they work in practice.
