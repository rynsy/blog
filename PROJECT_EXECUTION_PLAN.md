2. **Current focus**: What's being worked on today  
3. **Blockers**: Any impediments to progress
4. **Dependencies**: Work waiting on other agents

### **Inter-Agent Dependencies**
- **content-specialist** → **frontend-developer**: Content structure drives UI components
- **react-specialist** → **typescript-pro**: Module implementation drives type definitions
- **accessibility-tester** → **test-automator**: A11y requirements inform test scenarios
- **performance-specialist** → **full-stack-developer**: Optimization needs drive architecture decisions

### **Quality Gates**
- **Code review**: All code reviewed by relevant specialist
