Excellent deep dive into Gatsby's rendering strategies and how to optimize for performance. The GraphQL data layer is particularly well-designed for content-heavy sites.

The build-time optimizations are impressive - automatic image optimization, code splitting, and prefetching make for incredibly fast user experiences. The plugin ecosystem is also quite mature.

Some complexity around build times for large sites, but the performance benefits usually justify the tradeoffs for most use cases.
