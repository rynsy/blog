Added to reading list after multiple recommendations. Looks like a comprehensive resource covering everything from design tokens to component libraries.

The practical examples and case studies from major companies should provide good real-world context. Planning to use this as reference material for upcoming design system work.

Particularly interested in the sections on governance and evolution of design systems over time.
