This comprehensive guide covers essential best practices for building maintainable design systems with Tailwind CSS. The utility-first approach really shines when you establish consistent design tokens and component patterns.

Key takeaways include the importance of:
- Consistent spacing and typography scales
- Custom design tokens in your config
- Component abstraction at the right level
- Performance considerations for production builds

The documentation does an excellent job explaining when to use utilities vs components, and how to balance flexibility with maintainability.
