## ðŸŽ¯ Key UX Decisions & Rationale

### **1. Adaptive Rendering Strategy**
**Decision**: WebGL for high-end devices, Canvas 2D fallback for low-end  
**Rationale**: Ensures optimal performance across entire device spectrum while maintaining visual quality where possible

### **2. Layered Canvas Architecture**  
**Decision**: 3-tier canvas system (Background, Interactive, Overlay)
**Rationale**: Allows module isolation and performance optimization while maintaining visual coherence

### **3. Progressive Easter Egg Difficulty**
**Decision**: 5 difficulty levels from accidental to legendary discovery
**Rationale**: Rewards all levels of curiosity while respecting users who prefer straightforward experiences

### **4. Accessibility-First Approach**
**Decision**: Design for screen readers and keyboard navigation from start
**Rationale**: Ensures universal usability and often improves experience for all users

### **5. Mobile-First Responsive Design**
**Decision**: Touch interactions as primary, mouse as enhancement
**Rationale**: Reflects modern web usage patterns and ensures excellent mobile experience
